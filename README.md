## Special Features

Our room and machine management application offers several special features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** We have designed a user-friendly interface based on Java Swing, providing an intuitive user experience.

2. **Robust Database:** The MySQL database reliably stores all information about rooms, machines, and their assignments.

3. **Machine and Room Management:** The application allows you to create, modify, delete, and assign machines to rooms with just a few clicks.

4. **Hibernate for Persistence:** We use Hibernate to manage data persistence, making data storage and retrieval efficient.

5. **Remote Method Invocation (RMI):** RMI is used to enable secure communication between different application components, offering a seamless user experience and remote access.

6. **Customizable:** Our application can be customized to meet the specific needs of your organization.

### Used Technologies

- **Java:** Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for desktop, web, and mobile application development.

- **Hibernate:** Hibernate is an open-source persistence framework for Java that simplifies the management of persistent data in a relational database.

- **Java Swing:** Java Swing is a graphical library for developing user interfaces (UI) in Java, enabling the creation of interactive graphical interfaces for desktop applications.

- **MySQL:** MySQL is an open-source relational database management system widely used for data storage and management.

- **RMI (Remote Method Invocation):** RMI is a Java technology that enables communication between different Java machines, typically used for distributed applications.

These technologies play key roles in the development of your application, providing features such as database management, user interface creation, remote communication, and streamlined data persistence. They contribute to the robustness and user-friendliness of your room and machine management application.
